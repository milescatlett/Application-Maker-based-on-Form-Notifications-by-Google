      <i>Application Maker</i> was created from a script that expands the capability of a typical 
      Google Form to make it more like a fully-fledged application. This includes the ability to
      create a document from a template and email that link, along with a completion message, to
      the person who completed the form. In addition, emails can be sent to other recipients and
      the application includes other functions and customizations.</p>
      <p>At a minimum, you should write a title for your new document and place values in your 
      document template on the Template Headers page, and choose a document template and target folder 
      using the Template Picker and Folder Picker.</p>
      <p><i>Application Maker</i> is based on and is an expanded form of the 
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/quickstart/forms-add-on">
      Google Form Notifications</a> sample add-on. While it's an expanded form of the original,
      it has similar limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
      The number of notifications this add-on produces are limited by the owner's
      available email quota; it will not send email notifications if the owner's
      daily email quota has been exceeded. Collaborators using this add-on on the
      same form will be able to adjust the notification settings, but will not be
      able to disable the notification triggers set by other collaborators.
